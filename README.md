Notes
-----
This was meant to be used with Eclipse. If you use any other IDE, you will have to clone it using the way of your IDE of choice.

Windows
-------
Clone the repository, shift-right click in the folder, and open PowerShell / Command Prompt (depends if on Windows 10 or Windows 8.1/8/7) and put "gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse"

MacOS / Linux
-------------
Clone the repository, open terminal and use the cd command to go to the directory, and run "gradle setupDecompWorkspace eclipse"
